## Objectives

- Learn how to create typescript files.
- Learn how create a typescript project from scratch.
- Learn the process of compiling code to vanilla javascript.
- Learn to to use static type checking with typescript

## Getting Started

- Fork and Clone
- `npm init -y`
- `npx tsc --init`
- `mkdir src`

## What is TypeScript?

From [TypeScript Docs](www.typescriptlang.org):

> TypeScript is an open-source language which builds on JavaScript, one of the worldâ€™s most used tools, by adding static type definitions.
>
> Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing TypeScript to validate that your code is working correctly.
>
> Writing types can be optional in TypeScript, because type inference allows you to get a lot of power without writing additional code.

To sum it all up, TypeScript is a tool that provides us with the abilities to build applications while knowing what our data will look like ahead of time while still being able to write code in Javascript. This leads to:

- **LESS BUGS**
- **MAINTAINABLE AND SCALABLE CODEBASES**
- **DEVELOPER FRIENDLY DECLARATIVE CODE**

Although like with other new tools, there is a learning curve, but what makes TypeScript such a powerful tool is that it's just Javascript, albeit a more well dressed and elegant version.

Need a more simple explanation?

TypeScript is you dressed for a wedding, Javascript is you dressed in your pajamas... :) Although being dressed for a wedding isn't the most comfortable it is elegant and presentable, whereas being in your pajamas is comfortable and flexible but you really shouldn't go out in public wearing them.

Ever since the creation of Javascript, developers have always praised and renounced one thing... It's too loose of a language and that leads to hours trying to find bugs and broken code.

## Creating Your First TypeScript File

Start by creating an `index.ts` file in the `src` directory that you created when setting up this lesson.

The `.ts` file extension is unique to typescript in the same way that `.js` is to javascript and `.py` is to python.
